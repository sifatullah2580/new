=================

Basics:

	E-Mail Basics:		Terms:

			ESP:(Email Service Providers)

				Example:

					Gmail

					Yahoomail

			Spam:

				Doubt:

					Difference in spam and junk

		E-Mail Address:

			Basics:

			Syntax:

				user@system

		E-Mail Headers:

			Normal Headers:

				1. From:

					This header displays email address & optionally the name of sender, however, this can be easily forged and thus is not reallyx reliable.

				2. To:

					This header contains email address and optionally the name of primary recepient.

				3. CC:(Carbon Copy)

					This header contains list of email addresses of other recipients to whom the message is sent.

				4. BCC:(Blind Carbon Copy)

					This header is same as CC header, however, the difference between them is that email addresses of recipients listed in the BCC are not shown to the recipients of the message other than primary recepient.

				5. Date:

					This shows the date and time the email message was composed.

				6. Delivery Date:

					This shows the date and time at which the email was received by your (mt) service or email client.

				7. Subject:

					This is what the sender placed as a topic of the email content.

				8. Message-ID:

					This header is a unique string assigned by the email client when the message is first created. These can be easily forged.

				9. User-Agent:

					This header contains the email client that was used by the sender of the message.

				10. In-Reply-To:

					This is an optional header is only present if the email is a reply yo another email. Value of this header is Message-ID of the email to which the mail is a reply.

				11. References:

					This is an optional header which is is same as "In-Reply-To" header, however it contains Message-ID of every email in an email-thread as its value.

				12. Return-Path:

					This header contains email address to which email is sent if an error is encountered while sending the email to the intended inbox. In most cases, this header contains email address of sender(ie, 'the user' in this case).

				13. Reply-To:

					This is an optional header which is present only when the reply to an email is sent to an email address which is different from sender's email address.

				14. Mailed-By:

				15. Envelope-To:

				16. Signed-By:

				17. Received:(Most Important Email Header)

					This header contains a list of all the servers/computers through which the message traveled in order to reach the reciever.

					This header typically identifies the machine that received the mail and the machine from which the mail was received. So every time an email passes through a SMTP server, it inserts a Received header in itself. So usually, an email contains more than one Received header.

					First "Received:" header is of reciever's own system or mail server.

					Last "Received:" header is from where the mail originated.

					Note:

						Received headers are best read from bottom to top, ie, read the bottom-most Received header and then go towards the top.

					Note:

						Received is the most important header as every other header except Received can be forged.

				18. Mime-Version:

					This header specifies MIME version.

				19. Content-Type:

					This header indicates message format, ie, either HTML or PlanText.

				20. Message Body:

					This header contains the message written by the sender.

			Security Headers:

				1. Security:

				2. Authentication-Results:

				3. Received-SPF:

					Read SPF Section below.

				4. DKIM-Signature:

					Read DKIM Section below.

				5. Domainkey-Signature:

					Read DKIM Section below.

				6. ARC-Seal:

					Read ARC Section below.

				7. ARC-Message-Signature:

					Read ARC Section below.

				8. ARC-Authentication-Results:

					Read ARC Section below.

			X-Headers:

				Basics:

					Headers whose name begin with "X" are headers created by the recipient's email server and are considered to be trustworthy.

				Headers:

					1. X-Originating-IP:(Important Header)

						This header is important since it tells you the IP address of the computer that had sent the email.

						Note:

							If "X-Originating-IP" header is absent, then look into the "Received" headers to find the sender's IP address.

						Note:

							Once the email sender's IP address is found, you can search for it at http://www.arin.net/ to get which ISP or webhost the IP address belongs.

							If you are tracking a spam email, you can send a complaint to the owner of the originating IP address, ie, ISP or the webhost. Be sure to include all the headers of the email when filing a complaint.

					2. X-Received:

					3. X-Distribution:

					4. X-Mailer:

					5. X-UIDL:

					6. X-Spam-Score:

					7. X-Spam-Flag:

					8. X-Spam-Status:

						This header displays a spam score created by recipientâ€™s email client. Based on the score, Email is marked is spam or not-spam & this score also decides the value of "X-Spam-Level" header.

					9. X-Spam-Level:

						This header depends on value of "X-Spam-Status" header. Value of this header is in asterisks & number of asterisks is same as value of "X-Spam-Status" header's value.

						SMTP Server:(aka Relay Server)

							Basics:

								It refers to a computer or a software responsible for sending emails following SMTP.

								SMTP server receives emails from MUA, Then it relay those emails to another SMTP server or the incoming mail server(IMAP4 or POP3 server).

							SMTP Server Address:

								Type:

									Web Address:

										smtp.domain.xyz

										mail.domain.xyz

									Local Address:

										IPv4

							SMTP Relaying:

								Note:

									Relaying means "to receive & pass on".

							SMTP Queue:(aka Email Queue)

								It is a system that creates an array of emails that are waiting to be processed for delivery

						SMTP Record:(aka DNS MX Record)

							Basics:

								MX Record directs emails to SMTP server.

							Structure:

								Parts:

									Basics:

									Syntax:

								Example:

							Backup MX Record:

						SMTP Conversation:(3 Steps)

							Step-1: SMTP Handshake:(Establish TCP Connection)

								Process in which MUA connects to SMTP server via SMTP port in order to establish the connection between the sender & the SMTP Server is called SMTP Handshake.

							Step-2: Email Transfer:

								Step-2a: SMTP Session begins:

									Once the connection is established between sender & the SMTP server, the SMTP session begins.

									Once the session begins, MUA submits the senderâ€™s and recipientâ€™s email addresses, as well as the email body and attachments, to the SMTP server.

								Step-2b:

									MTA checks whether the domain name of the recipient and the sender are same:

										A. If domain names are same:

											SMTP server sends the email directly to the recipientâ€™s POP3 or IMAP4 server.

										B. If domain names are different:

											Step-1:

												Sender's SMTP server requests DNS to get MX records to retrieve recipient's IP address.

											Step-2:

												Senderâ€™s SMTP server connects to recipientâ€™s SMTP server using recipient's IP and then relays the email via SMTP Relaying.

											Step-3:

												Recipientâ€™s SMTP server verifies the incoming email. If the domain and user name has been recognized, the server forwards the email to the POP3 or IMAP4 server.

									Note:

										If the recipientâ€™s server is not available (down or busy), the email will be put into an SMTP queue.

							Step-3: Termination:(Close TCP Connection)

							Note:

								Very commonly, terms "MTA" & "SMTP Server" are used interchangeably, but they are not same.

								MTA is just a software that is installed on SMTP Server.

								Note:

									Read Agents Section to read about MTA.

E-Mail Security & Bypass:

	Message Encryption Protocols:

		Basics:

			Mechanisms/protocols to encrypt the message & attachments.

		Mechanisms:

			SSL/TLS:

			S/MIME:(Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)

				Basics:

			PGP:(Pretty Good Privacy)

				Read Password Cracking & Cryptography Sheet.

			Bitmessage:

	E-Mail Authentication Protocols:(aka Authentication Mechanisms)(aka Authentication Systems)

		Basics:

			Email authentication is process of using multiple methods/mechanisms/protocols/systems/frameworks to ensure that E-Mails/messages are not faked/forged/Tampered before they get delivered.

			Reciever Servers (Mail servers on the receiving end) use these protocols to verify sender's identity and to check that emails werenâ€™t altered in transit, and they inform reciever servers what to do with messages that arenâ€™t authenticated.

			Usuallt unauthenticated e-mails are sent into SPAM section.

		In-Built Authentication Mechanisms:(1)

			SMTP Auth:

				Read SMTP AUTH Sub-Section above.

		Additional Mechanisms:(4)

			A. SPF, DKIM & DMARC:

				Note:

					I have put these three in a seperate category as they are quite similar.

				Mechanisms:

					1. SPF:(Sender Policy Framework)

						Basics:

							SPF orignated as an anti-spam mechanism. However, now its used as an anti-phishing mechanism.

							SPF is compatible with DKIM.

						SPF Working:

							Overview:

								Let's say, i have a domain xyz.com with IPv4 address 'a.b.c.d' & this domain allows to send emails. Some attacker spoofed his email id to '1234@xyz.com' by just changing an email header and due to lack of SPF, he succeded in doing damage to victim.

								So, i created a SPF DNS record and according to it, any email sent from any IP address other than 'a.b.c.d' is unauthenticated. So when a person(victim) recieves email from email address '1234@xyz.com', victim's email client queries DNS server of xyx.com for it's SPF record, and compares the IP address mentioned in SPF record with the IP address of attacker. If these two IP addresses do not match, then, the email client moves the mail to spam.

							SPF Record:(aka SPF DNS Record)(aka SPF DNS TXT Record)

								Basics:

									SPF Record is a special type of TXT DNS Record which is used to prevent Email Spoofing.

									Note:

										A domain can have only one SPF Record.

								Structure:

									Basics:

										SPF records consists of 3 parts.

									Parts:(4)

										A. SPF Mechanisms:

											Basics:

												A mechanism is a way to specify a range of IP addresses.

											Types:(8)

												1. ALL:

													Basics:

													Syntax:

												2. A:

													Basics:

														It specifies domain name allowed to send emails for the domain

													Syntax:

														a=<domain>

												3. MX:

													Basics:

													Syntax:

												4. PTR:

													Basics:

													Syntax:

												5. exists:

													Basics:

													Syntax:

												6. INCLUDE:

													Basics:

														Its used to authorize 3rd party domains/organizations to send emails on behalf of the domain.

													Syntax:

														include:<domain_name>

												7. IP4:

													Basics:

														It specifies IPv4 address/range allowed to send emails for the domain

													Syntax:

														ip4=<IPv4>

												8. IP6:

													Basics:

														It specifies IPv6 address/range allowed to send emails for the domain

													Syntax:

														ip6=<IPv6>

										B. SPF Qualifiers:

											Basics:

												A qualifier can be used with any spf mechanism to specify the result of mechanism's evaluation.

											Types:(4)

												1. +:(Default)

													Its used to allow if SPF mechanism evaluation is true.

												2. -:

													Its used to do nothing irrespective of result of SPF mechanism evaluation.

												3. ~:

												4. ?:

													Its used to allow if SPF mechanism evaluation is flase.

										C. SPF Modifiers:

											Basics:

											Types:(2)

												1. EXP:

													Basics:

													Syntax:

												2. REDIRECT:

													Basics:

														Note:

															Redirect Modifier is different from Include Mechanism as:

													Syntax:

										D. Others:

											1. V:

												Basics:

													It specifies SPF version

												Syntax:

													v=<spf_version>

											2. ALL:

												Basics:

													It tells the server what to do with emails that are not authorized.

												Syntax:

													-all => Reject all such emails

													~all => Send all such emails to spam

													+all => Send all emails to inbox irrespective of its source

									Note:

										It's mandatory to either end SPF record with 'all' or include a 'redirect' in the record.

								Example:

									v=spf1 +a +mx +ip4:194.123.23.0/24 +ip4:149.23.126.0/21 +ip4:92.8.4.23 â€“all

						SPF Enumeration:

									Read Active Information Gathering Sheet to read more about Dig.

					2. DKIM:(DomainKeys Identified Mail)(aka DKIM Authentication)

						Origin of DKIM:

							DK:(DomainKeys)(aka Yahoo's DomainKeys)

								DomainKeys is a deprecated e-mail authentication system developed by Yahoo in 2007 to verify email sender's domain name & integrity of message.

							IIM:(Identified Internet Mail)

								IIM was developed by Cisco

						Basics:

							DKIM was created in 2013 by Yahoo by merging IIM & DomainKeys.

							DKIM is used to verify the authenticity of email, in order to detect & prevent email forgery/tampering/spam by adding Digital Signature Header in email headers.

							DKIM is compatible with SPF & DMARC.

							Why do we need DKIM:

								Normally, there is "From" Header to identify the sender of an email, however, it can be edited & thus is not reliable. So, DKIM signature header acts as the identifier.

							DKIM Advantages:

								1. ISPs build domain reputation over time based on DKIM.

								2. SPAM Reduction

							Note:

								"DKIM is not same as TLS/SSL" as DKIM do not encrypt the email, so any person can easily the emails in absence of TLS/SSL. DKIM is only responsible for verifying the authenticity of the email.

						DKIM Working:

							Overview:

								Step-1:

									Sender sever sends these two things:

										A. Message signed with 'DKIM Signature' using 'Signing Algorithm'. This hash is stored inside 'DKIM-Signature' Header.

										B. Orignal Message

								Step-2:

									Reciever queries Sender's DNS server for DKIM Record to get Public key.

								Step-3:

									Reciever uses Sender's public key to decrypt the 'DKIM-Signature' header's value.

									If decrypted value is same as 'Orignal Message', DKIM allows the message as its valid. Otherwise, it sends the mail to SPAM.

							DKIM Structure:(2)

								DKIM enumeration basically means reading the DKIM record.

							Using Dig:

								dig <selector_name>._domainkey.<domain_name.com> TXT

					3. DMARC:(Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)

						Basics:

							DMARC is an email authentication policy system built on SPF & DKIM.

							It basically tells the reciever's sever what to do in case both SPF & DKIM fail to verify/authenticate a mail, it also produces a weekly XML report to show the actions DMARC took.

						DMARC Working:

							DMARC Record:(aka DMARC DNS Record)(aka DMARC DNS TXT Record)

								Basics:

									A DMARC Record is a DNS TXT Record consisting of one or more DMARC Policies.

								DMARC Policy:

									Basics:

										DMARC policy determines what happens to an email after it is checked against SPF and DKIM records.

										DMARC policy determines if failure results in the email being marked as spam, email getting blocked, or email being delivered to its intended recipient.
